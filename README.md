# cupcake

cupcake is a Linux Distribution based on Arch Linux that sets out to accomplish a few goals.

This distribution is currently in the planning phase. Everything is being planned out before actually being setup (hence the stubs).

* Custom package manager. Pacman is fantastic for the purposes of Arch Linux (consider looking into it if you haven't, it's got a lot of great functionality, and the way Arch does packaging is absolutely beautiful as well), but cupcake aims to have a more user-based installation.

* Cleaner root file system. The normal file system hierarchy of Arch Linux, and by extensions the file system hierarchy standard, is quite dirty in my opinion.

* Be systemd-free. Systemd is a bit of a cancer in the Linux community, and is too thick for the purposes of cupcake.

# Plans

### Installation

Installation of cupcake should be just as simple as installing Arch Linux.

Users should only need to change their pacman configuration when booted into a live CD (from Arch Linux's mirrorlist to cupake's), and installation of the system will continue as normal (i.e. users will still use `base` to install the base system, but it uses the cupcake base group, rather than Arch's).

### Init system

The init system should be BSD-like, in that `/etc/rc` starts the system itself, and users add things to `/etc/rc.local`. The init script should not handle anything outside of simply starting the system.

This is still being planned out, and is currently the least planned feature.

### Package manager

cupcake aims to provide a more user-oriented installation than other distributions. The package manager, unlike most, will (and should) be ran most often outside of root.

The package manager, ckpkg, has a handful of philosophies:

* Packages that aren't required by the underlying system should be installed to the users home directory, so as not to create bloat on the system itself.

* Users should be able to choose whether they want to build/compile packages themselves, install prebuilt binaries, and/or keep multiple versions of a single package installed.

### File system

* Kernel related directories (`/sys`, `/dev`, `/proc`, etc.) should be a child of `/kernel`.
* Non-home directories (`/usr`, `/tmp`, `/bin`, etc.) should be a child of `/system`.
* The home directory should be more sensible to a new user, and is renamed to `/users` (e.g. `/home/grace` -> `/users/grace`)
* Root's home directory as a child of `/users`
* `/boot` remains untouched.
